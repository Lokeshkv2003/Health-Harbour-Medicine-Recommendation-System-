# Health-Harbour-Medicine-Recommendation-System-
Healthcare plays a critical role in ensuring the well-being of individuals, and timely medical
intervention is essential to address health concerns effectively. However, identifying the right
medicine based on symptoms can be a complex process for both patients and healthcare providers.
The Medicine Recommendation System (Health Harbour) aims to bridge this gap by leveraging
machine learning to provide accurate and personalized recommendations.

The primary objective of this project is to develop a system capable of recommending appropriate
medicines based on symptoms provided by the user. By analysing the user's input, the system
identifies potential diseases and suggests suitable medicines. In addition to medicine
recommendations, the system provides valuable guidance on diet, precautions, and workout
routines, ensuring a holistic approach to health management.

The system incorporates a curated list of 187 symptoms, allowing users to select up to four
symptoms to describe their condition. The machine learning model, trained on a comprehensive
medical dataset, predicts the disease with high accuracy and maps it to the corresponding
medicine. This approach reduces the dependency on manual diagnosis and helps users make
informed decisions about their health.

Furthermore, the project emphasizes user-friendliness through an intuitive interface built using
Streamlit. This interface simplifies the process of symptom selection and displays actionable
results, making it accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise.
By combining advanced algorithms with user-centric design, the Medicine Recommendation
System has the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery. It addresses key challenges such as
improving diagnosis accuracy, reducing delays in treatment, and promoting self-care. This system
is a significant step toward leveraging technology to enhance healthcare accessibility and
efficiency.
